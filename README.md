# dashboard

> dashboard page which contains 3 charts, for example(line chart, donuts chart, column chart) and those charts must render as per priority (3 priorities) so chart 1 (line chart) first priority will render and after finish render the second priority will fire and so on, its somehow like lazy-loading but as per predefined priority.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8000
npm run dev

# Application is running on port 8080
http://localhost:8080

```
